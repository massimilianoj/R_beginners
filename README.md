# R_beginners
This repository contains resources to learn how to work with R and edit with R Markdown.

It is made up of 3 main documents:

1. "R for Beginners": it is an introduction to R. This document is rich in images that are snapshots of most all steps I try to explain. It is made up of 2 parts.
Part 1 is a general overview to R.
Part 2 is aiming at building a database. Therefore, all the operations, packages and functions used have this goal. Consider it as a previous step to an econometric analysis.The content is the following:
 - Packages
 - R Scripts and R Markdown (just an intorduction because it will the focus of the next document)
 - Class and Structure
 - Select and Name Columns
 - Transform Database Log-Wide
 - Rename Single Columns and Drop Variables
 - Operations on only some Columns of the Database
 - Subset the Database
 - Merge Two Databases
 - Dates in R
 - Plot
 
I uploaded the databases I downloaded from the OECD (named ppp, cpi, gdp) and that I used for the examples. In this way it is possible to replicate.

2. "Edit with R Markdown": this documents show how to edit in R Markdown. It supposes that you installed LaTeX system to knit it to pdf. 
It contains two full YAML header used to produce this document and "R for Beginners"

3. "LaTeX for Mathematics": it shows how to write mathematical expressions with LaTeX language. It contains various examples.

These documents are drafts. They could be changed in future. Any advice to make it clearer and better or to add new operations is welcome.
